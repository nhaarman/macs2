This assumes NuSMV is available in your PATH, and cmake is installed, using Linux.

To compile and run the generator:

> cmake -G "Unix Makefiles"
> make
> ./sokoban_nusmv_generator <screen input>

Replace <screen input> by the path to a Sokoban screen. The program will ask to run NuSMV, and display the counter example if any.
