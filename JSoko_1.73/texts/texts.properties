nimrod.helpText = How to use\n\n   Click on the coloured squares to set the new theme colours.\n\n   A Swing theme is defined by eight colours, although only four\n   are used in the wild\:\n   - Black, for texts\n   - White, for texts fields background\n   - Background\: the background colour of almost everything.\n   - Selection\: the colour for focused controls\n\n   'Selection' and 'Background' groups have four squares, and one\n   is slightly separated, because although Swing uses three colours\n   for each category, those three colours must be coordinated, so \n   they must be the same colour, but more dark. For example, if we \n   want a grey background, the first square will be 'our' grey, the\n   second will be lighter and the third will be even lighter.\n\n   You can define the squares one by one, but if you define the \n   separated square, the three other colours will be automatically set.\n\n   Use the slider to set the menus opacity and the another one to\n   set the JInternalFrames opacity.\n\n   After you have done that you can test your current settings\n   by pressing the 'Test' button.\n\n   Browse through the other tabs and the menu to see how your\n   settings have influenced the appearance.\n\n   Use the two buttons 'Open' and 'Save' to open and save theme files.\n\n   If you want to use the theme in JSoko load the theme by loading it\n   from the Settings menu\:\n   Settings->Look and Feel->NimROD L&F->Load configuration
