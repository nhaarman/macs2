The game
--------

"Sokoban" is a puzzle game invented in Japan in 1982 by Hiroyuki Imabayashi.
The rules are very simple but the game itself is not :-)

The Rules
---------

The object of the game is to push boxes to specially marked positions in a level.
The boxes can only be pushed, never pulled, and only one box can be pushed at a time.
The player can only move on "free" fields (= no wall and no box).
A level is solved if all boxes have been pushed to specially marked positions. 
Each field can be occupied by only one of the following level elements at a time:
the player, a box, a wall.

Just start the game. You easily will learn the rules by playing the game :-)

The computer will help you in situations where you lost the possibility
to solve the level (for example, if you pushed a box into a corner)
by showing you the message that the level isn't solvable anymore.
Note: Recognizing situations that are unsolvable can be very difficult.
Hence, JSoko shows this message only for some kinds of unsolvable situations
it can recognize.


How to Play
-----------

You can move the player by using the arrow keys or by using the mouse (or both :-)
